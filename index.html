        <p style="text-indent: 20px">Thank you for visiting my webpage! My name is Samih Mabsout, I am 25 years old, and I am from Lebanon!
            I graduated in December 2016 with a BSc in Computer Science. I am currently pursuing my Masters in
            Management Information Systems at The University of Houston,
            and I also work part-time as a Guitar Salesman at Guitar Center!

        <p style="text-indent: 20px">
            I am a Certified Ethical Hacker, I have always been very curious as to how things work, which is why I am very fascinated with coding.    
            People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with excellent communication skills.
